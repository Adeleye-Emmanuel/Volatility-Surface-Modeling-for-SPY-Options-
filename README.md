# Volatility-Surface-Modeling-from-Market-Data-Using-SVI-and-Machine-Learning
This project models the implied volatility surface of SPY options using both parametric (SVI) and non-parametric (machine learning) techniques. It preprocesses real market data, fits an arbitrage-free SVI surface, and enhances the modeling with Random Forest and neural network regressors. The surfaceâ€™s curvature and dynamics are analyzed through gradient extraction, revealing local skew and term structure behavior. This end-to-end framework provides a robust, interpretable, and data-driven approach to understanding option volatility behavior across strikes and maturities.
