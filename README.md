# Volatility-Surface-Modeling-from-Market-Data-Using-SVI-and-Machine-Learning
This project models the implied volatility surface of SPY options using both parametric (SVI) and non-parametric (machine learning) techniques. It preprocesses real market data, fits an arbitrage-free SVI surface, and enhances the modeling with Random Forest and neural network regressors.
